The People's Army of Vietnam `(PAVN; Vietnamese: Quân Đội Nhân Dân Việt Nam)`, also known as the Vietnamese People's Army, is the military force of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The PAVN is a part of Vietnam People's Armed Forces and includes: Ground Force (including Strategic Rear Forces), Navy, Air Force, Border Defence Force, and Coast Guard. However, Vietnam does not have a specific separate Ground Force or Army branch. All ground troops, army corps, military districts and specialised arms belong to the Ministry of Defence, directly under command of the Central Military Commission, Minister of Defence, and General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. The military flag of the PAVN is the flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, with the words Quyết thắng (Determination to win) added in yellow at the top left.
