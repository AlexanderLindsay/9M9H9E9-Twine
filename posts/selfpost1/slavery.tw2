As a free species, we have seen totalitarianism before, 

|again)[But when it arises again, aided by advanced information and biological technology, it will have a new and unprecedented ability to envelop the entire earth and place humanity in an unalterable state of total mental and physical slavery that will last for uncounted millennia until the earth becomes (link-reveal:"uninhabitable")[(show:?outcome)].]

|outcome)[Not only do I believe that this outcome is possible, I believe that it is overwhelmingly likely. Out of all the trillions of possible futures arrayed before us, 99.9999% of them result in this outcome. As Christ said, "Wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But narrow is the [[gate->selfpost1-gate]] and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."]
