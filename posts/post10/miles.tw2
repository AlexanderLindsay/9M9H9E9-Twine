The Soviets quickly realized that the portal was growing out of control. In previous instances, they had simply bombed the site from the air. But in this case, the enormous cylinders and attendant incident zone, extending to the [[//edge of space//↗->post10-space]], prevented this as well as missile strikes. There was also an exceptionally large lateral incident zone around the portal, with segmentation occurring miles out from the site.

Alarmed by the zone's uncontrolled growth and the growing underground tunnels (aka "ant farms") the Soviets worked feverishly to construct a [[//hydrogen bomb//↗->post10-bomb]] of unprecedented power which could be detonated from outside the incident zone and still [[collapse->post10-collapse]] the portal.
