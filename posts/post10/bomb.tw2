<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon" target="_blank">Excerpt from Wikipedia</a>

A thermonuclear weapon is a second generation nuclear weapon design using a secondary nuclear fusion stage consisting of fusion fuel, implosion tamper and sparkplug which is bombarded by the energy released by the detonation of a primary fission bomb within, compressing the fuel material (tritium, deuterium or lithium deuteride) and causing a fusion reaction. Some advanced designs use fast neutrons produced by this second stage to ignite a third fast fission or fusion stage. The fission bomb and fusion fuel are placed near each other in a special radiation-reflecting container called a radiation case that is designed to contain x-rays for as long as possible. The result is greatly increased explosive power when compared to single-stage fission weapons. The device is colloquially referred to as a hydrogen bomb or, an H-bomb, because it employs the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen.
