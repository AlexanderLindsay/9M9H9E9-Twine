As I understand it, the portal was opened because of experiments taking place in the [[//CIA's antarctic station//â†—->post3-station]] in the early 80s, and Falklands quickly became a center for portal research.

Being underwater, the portal had an enormous incident zone, and segmented whales and other undersea debris would regularly wash up on the islands' [[shores->post3-shores]].
