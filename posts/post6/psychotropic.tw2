<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" target="_blank">Excerpt from Wikipedia</a>

A psychoactive drug, psychopharmaceutical, or psychotropic is a chemical substance that changes brain function and results in alterations in perception, mood, consciousness or behavior.[1] These substances may be used medically, recreationally, to purposefully improve performance or alter one's consciousness, as entheogens, for ritual, spiritual, or shamanic purposes, or for research. Some categories of psychoactive drugs, which have therapeutic value, are prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners. Examples include anesthetics, analgesics, anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian drugs as well as medications used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and stimulant medications. Some psychoactive substances may be used in the detoxification and rehabilitation programs for persons dependent on or addicted to other psychoactive drugs.
