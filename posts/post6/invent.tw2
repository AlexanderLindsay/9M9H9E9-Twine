The [[//Book of Revelations//↗->post6-revelations]] is also considered to be a description of a flesh interface; especially the [[description->post6-description]] of [[//New Jerusalem//↗->post6-jerusalem]].

My problem with this is that it is all speculative. It's like when modern psychologists diagnose historical figures.

I'm [[uncomfortable->post6-uncomfortable]] with this level of speculation.
