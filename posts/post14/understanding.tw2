::post14-understanding

The first subject to come back encased was an 8-year-old girl we had named [[Jingles->post14-Jingles]].

We sent Jingles into flesh interface and an object returned 2 minutes later, which is a pretty long time for an interface. It was a large organic sac lined with veins, vaguely resembling a human lung, about 4 feet long. We x-rayed it and saw the skeleton inside and cut it open. Sure enough, Jingles was inside, naked and covered with blood, with no hair on her head. There was an umbilical cord attached to her bellybutton, which was attached to a sort of [[//placenta//â†—->post14-placenta]].

We had a problem with the surgeons trying to [[harm->post14-harm]] her.
