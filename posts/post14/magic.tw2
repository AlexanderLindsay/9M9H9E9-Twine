<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" target="_blank">Excerpt from Wikipedia</a>

Magic or sorcery is the use of rituals, symbols, actions, gestures, and language with the aim of exploiting supernatural forces. The term magic has a variety of meanings, and there is no widely agreed upon definition of what it is or how it can be used.

Religious scholars have defined magic in different ways. One approach, associated with the anthropologists Edward Tylor and James G. Frazer, suggests that magic and science are opposites. An alternative approach, associated with the sociologists Marcel Mauss and Emile Durkheim, pits magic in antipathy to religion, arguing that the former takes place in private, while the latter is a communal and organized activity.
