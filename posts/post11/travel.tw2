Lisa was a 9 year old girl sent through the Groom Lake interface in 1975. The [[//Groom Lake//↗->post11-lake]] interface connects to the so-called Sister City (technically, "persistent locus") known as "[[//The Hanging Temples//↗->post11-temple]]".

She stayed there for 5 days of normal-time, but only 48 seconds of beyond-time, a marked discrepancy. Upon returning, she did not recall anything beyond becoming drowsy for a moment. She slept well that night, and in the morning she recounted a [[dream->post11-dream]] to the doctors, before dying later in the day.
