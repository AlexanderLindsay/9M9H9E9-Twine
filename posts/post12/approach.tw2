The Soviets approached the mystery of the flesh interfaces the same way they approached their space program. The first humans in space (the so-called "[[//Lost Cosmonauts//↗->post12-cosmonauts]]" who were never officially acknowledged) were just ordinary people, culled from the [[//gulags//↗->post12-gulags]], with no more control over their missions than [[//Laika the dog//↗->post12-laika]].

[[//The Americans//↗->post12-americans]], on the other hand, started with professional men, usually from the [[military->post12-military]].

Likewise, when it was discovered that objects and even animals which entered the flesh interfaces occasionally returned unharmed, the Americans began training men to enter the interfaces.
