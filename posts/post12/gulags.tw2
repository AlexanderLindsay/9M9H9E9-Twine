The Gulag (`Russian: ГУЛАГ, tr. GULAG; IPA: [ɡʊˈlak] acronym of Главное управление лагерей, Glavnoye Upravleniye LAGerej, lit. "Main Camp Administration"`) was the government agency that administered and controlled the Soviet forced-labor camp system during Joseph Stalin's rule from the 1930s up until the 1950s. The term is also commonly used to reference any forced-labor camp in the Soviet Union. The camps housed a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners. Large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures, such as NKVD troikas (secret police) and other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union.
