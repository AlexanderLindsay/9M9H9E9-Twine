::post13-no

The hut was very hot and muggy. Even by the incredibly humid standards of [[//Vietnam//â†—->post13-Vietnam]], it was incredibly, incredibly humid in there. Even the Buddha statues were sweating. Their faces were literally coated with drops of moisture. Everybody noticed that there was something weird going with the air. There was something off about the pressure. So we just tossed everything. Picked all the shit up and tossed it out of the hut. Sure enough, when we picked up the big platform that held the altar, there was [[something->post13-something]] under it.
