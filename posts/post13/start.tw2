Until we found the village, we had suspected that the detectors were just props. Just toys given to us by the [[//CIA//â†—->post13-CIA]] guys to reassure us. Nobody trusted the (link-reveal:"spooks")[(show:?spooks)]. 3 days through the jungle, and these detectors had not detected a fucking thing. But before we even saw the first hut, the needles on all the detectors started moving in unison. If they were phony toys, it was a cool little special effect. The needles swayed back and forth and all the little metal boxes let out this spooky "ooaaooaaaooo" sound all in unison, like a school choir. Very weird. We turned them [[off->post13-off]].
