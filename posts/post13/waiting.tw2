::post13-waiting

After clearing the village, we didn't know what to do. So we turned one of the detectors on and wandered around to see what was up. The detector started going nuts around one of the bigger huts in the middle of the village. We had already cleared it, but we went in again. There was a big altar inside, with candles and [[//Buddhas//â†—->post13-buddhas]] and gold signs with dink writing and shit. We figured maybe one of the buddha statues was setting the detectors off, [[but no->post13-no]].
